## Conclusion on the performance of the baseline trading algorithm

Looking at the Baseline Cumulative Returns Plot, the Strategy Returns performance is consistent with the actual returns upto the middle of 2018; at which point, the Strategy Returns are predicted to outperform the Actual Returns. The Strategy Returns predictions follow a similar trend with that of the Actual Returns.
